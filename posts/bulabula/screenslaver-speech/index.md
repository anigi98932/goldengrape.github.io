```
超级英雄就是你们用来
Superheroes are part of your brainless desire...

模拟真实体验的无脑幻想之一
to replace true experience with simulation.

你们不说话  却爱看脱口秀
You don't talk, you watch talk shows.

你们不玩游戏  却爱看游戏节目
You don't play games, you watch game shows.

旅行  恋爱  冒险
Travel, relationships, risk...

这些有意义的经验都得被包装一番
every meaningful experience must be packaged...

以供你们坐得远远的进行观看
and delivered to you to watch at a distance.

这样你们就能安安稳稳
So that you can remain ever sheltered...

不思进取
ever passive...

只要做贪婪的消费者
ever ravenous consumers...

甚至都不愿意从自己的沙发上站起来
who can't bring themselves to rise from their couches...

进行一场酣畅淋漓的人生体验
break a sweat and participate in life.

你们希望超级英雄来保护你们
You want superheroes to protect you...

让你们自己变得更加无助
and make yourselves ever more powerless in the process.

你们告诉自己  有人在保护你们
While you tell yourselves you're being looked after.

你们的利益得到了满足
That your interests are being served.

你们的权利得到了维护
And your rights are being upheld.

所以系统可以继续对你们进行搜刮
So that the system can keep stealing from you...

并对你施以微笑
smiling at you all the while.

来啊  派你们的超级英雄来阻止我
Go ahead, send your Supers to stop me.

拿好你们的零食  盯紧屏幕
Grab your snacks, watch your screens,

看看会发生什么事
and see what happens.

你们不再是掌控者
You are no longer in control.

我才是
I am.
